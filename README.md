# Groupie Trackers

Groupie Trackers is a web application that retrieves and manipulates data from a provided API to display comprehensive information about bands and artists. The project focuses on creating an interactive, user-friendly website.

## Introduction

Groupie Trackers works with an API divided into four main parts:

- **Artists**: Contains details about bands and artists including names, images, the year they started their activities, the date of their first album, and member information.
- **Locations**: Provides information about the last and upcoming concert venues.
- **Dates**: Lists the dates for the last and upcoming concerts.
- **Relation**: Links the data from the above parts (artists, dates, and locations) to create a cohesive dataset.

The goal is to process this data and present it on a website using various visual formats such as blocks, cards, tables, lists, pages, and graphics. Additionally, the project implements an event-driven system that demonstrates client-server interactionâ€”triggering server requests based on client-side actions.

## Architecture

The project is divided into two primary components:

- **Backend**:  
  - **Language**: Go  
  - **Responsibilities**: Handles API data fetching, data manipulation, serving processed data to the frontend, and managing client-triggered events.
  - **Best Practices**: Follows error handling and stability guidelines to ensure the application does not crash.
  
- **Frontend**:  
  - **Technologies**: HTML (with potential use of CSS and JavaScript for enhanced interactivity)  
  - **Responsibilities**: Displays artist and concert data using various visualizations, and facilitates interactions that trigger server-side events.
